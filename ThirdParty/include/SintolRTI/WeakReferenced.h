  /// assigned.
  /// The reference count for this object is stored in a secondary object that
  /// is shared with all weak pointers to this current object. This way we
  /// have an atomic decision using the reference count of this current object
  /// if the backref is still valid. At the time where the atomic count is
  /// equal to zero the object is considered dead.
  ///
  /// Special care is taken for objects that are not yet assigned to
  /// a shared pointer but weak pointers are already assigned and actions need
  /// to be taken with the weak referenced objects.
  /// To make this work, a new allocated object has its last bit set in the
  /// reference count. Consequently you can already call WeakRef::lock() and
  /// get back a valid object, even if we do not yet have assigned that to
  /// a SharedPtr. Once we assign the pointer to s SharedPtr through a raw
  /// pointer argument, this bit is cleared. This way, the object is not
  /// deleted until we have a more permanent reference to the object assigned.
  /// The following example shows the intented use of that:
  ///
  /// O* object = new Object;
  /// { // assume some scope that might be called in initialization of Object
  ///   WeakPtr<O> w = o;
  ///   SharedPtr<O> s = o.lock(); // valid
  /// }
  /// SharedPtr<O> permanent = object;
  ///
  /// Whereas the following code doesn't work as expected:
  ///
  /// WeakPtr<O> w = new Object;
  /// SharedPtr<O> s = w.lock();
  ///
  /// In this case the last bit is still set and the Object instance is
  /// never destroyed.
